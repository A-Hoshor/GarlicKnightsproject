              <p>
                Answer: Intermittently if I'm being honest! I will read everyday

              </p>
              <p>
                Answer: Certainly! Well, I have a Bachelors in Marketing, and I
                also have a Masters in Business Administration. I work fulltime
                remotely for the government, and I'm married with a child that's

              <p>
                Answer: I would say I'm pretty experienced. I use technology
                everyday for work and personal use, such as GPS, social media,
                healthcare, and banking apps.

              <p>
                Answer: I would use it to find books that I would enjoy reading
                and to find books that I could recommend to my friends and
                family. Although at the moment, I don't have a specific book in
                mind.
